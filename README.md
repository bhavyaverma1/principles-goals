#PRINCIPLES 2019_
A simple clean working draft of mah principles.

## 1. Prioritize family
Juz coz family comes first. Quote--“A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.” 
? Mario Puzo, The Godfather

## 2. Patience
Being young we have not just years, but _decades_ to execute on our goals. So **be patient**.

## 3. Consistency
### 3.1 Power of Habits
Make use of it. Cue + Routine ==Reward. Its that simple.
### 3.2 Show up.
### 3.3 Understand the diff between 'enjoy' and 'pleasure' and hence enjoy the process.

## 4. Minimalism
A tool that can assist you in finding freedom. And discipline==freedom

## 5. Essentialism
You are constantly being bombarded with new and interesting opportunities. You will need to say no to 90% of them. Don't be afraid of this. If you are patient, you will eventually have the meaningful opportunities that you are so desperate for.
